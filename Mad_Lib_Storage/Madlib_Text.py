    mlb1 = ['Today, my fabulous camp group went to a(an) 1 amusement park. It was a fun park with lots of cool 2 and enjoyable play structures. When we got there, my kind counselor shouted loudly, \"Everybody off the 3.\" We all pushed out in a terrible hurry. My counselor handed out yellow tickets, and we scurried in. I was so excited! I couldn\'t figure out what exciting thing to do first. I saw a scary roller coaster I really liked so, I 4 ran over to get in the long line that had about 5 people in it. When I finally got on the roller coaster I was 6. In fact I was so nervous my two knees were knocking together. This was the 7 ride I had ever been on! In about two minutes I heard the crank and grinding of the gears. Thatâ€™s when the ride began! When I got to the bottom, I was a little 8 but I was proud of myself. The rest of the day went 9. It was a(n) * day at the fun park'
